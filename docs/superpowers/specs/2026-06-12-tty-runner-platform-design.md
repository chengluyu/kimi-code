# TTY Runner Platform Design

Date: 2026-06-12

## Goal

Build a local platform for testing and inspecting long-running Kimi TUI workflows without opening visible terminal windows.

The platform should let a developer:

- Start and monitor many hidden PTY sessions in the background.
- Drive each session with a declarative YAML workflow.
- Configure each session's command, arguments, working directory, environment, terminal columns, and terminal rows.
- Record what the PTY produced and what scripted user input was sent.
- Watch each running PTY session live in a web interface.
- Replay each finished run in the same web interface, including real-time timing.
- Mark user actions and checkpoints on the replay progress bar.
- Validate visible text and ANSI terminal attributes, such as foreground color, background color, and text style.

## Scope Lock

This design intentionally follows these constraints:

- Use hidden PTY sessions. Do not create or automate visible terminal windows.
- Do not test visible terminal rendering, fonts, pixels, screenshots, palette mapping, or app-specific rendering behavior.
- Validate terminal model state from the ANSI stream: visible text, rectangular regions, foreground/background attributes, and text style attributes.
- Record events only. Do not record periodic screen snapshots in the first version.
- Do not add security hardening in the first version.
- Do not add automatic throttling, queueing, resource scheduling, or rate-limit management in the first version.
- If a run crashes or is killed, stop recording, preserve the event log, and show the final reconstructed state. Do not repair or resume broken runs.

## Architecture

The platform has five pieces:

1. **Run Manager**
   Starts, tracks, lists, and stops many hidden PTY sessions concurrently. It does not schedule or throttle runs; it runs what the user starts.

2. **Scenario Executor**
   Executes declarative YAML workflows against individual sessions.

3. **Recorder**
   Writes a timestamped event log for each run.

4. **Validator**
   Replays events into a terminal model and checks visible text and ANSI cell attributes.

5. **Web App**
   Lists runs and replays event logs in a browser-based terminal player.

This is a new web app. It should not be designed as an enhancement to the existing session visualizer. Shared utilities are fine as an implementation detail, but the product surface is a separate run inspection app for TTY workflows.

## Developer Workflows

Design the product around what a developer needs to do in the web app. API details are implementation support, not the main design.

### Launch Runs

The developer can start a run from the web app by choosing a YAML scenario. Before launch, they can review and override:

- Scenario file.
- Command and arguments.
- Working directory.
- Environment overrides.
- Terminal columns and rows.
- Run label or description.

The developer can also launch a suite that starts many scenarios at once. A suite starts the listed runs together and groups their results in the UI.

### Monitor Running Sessions

The dashboard shows all active and recent runs. It should make the current state obvious without opening every run.

Each run card shows:

- Scenario name and run ID.
- Status: `running`, `waiting`, `passed`, `failed`, `killed`, or `crashed`.
- Current scenario step.
- Current wait or assertion, if one is active.
- Elapsed time.
- Time since last PTY output.
- Command, working directory, and terminal size.
- Assertion count and failure count.
- Exit code or signal, once the process exits.

The dashboard should support a compact "terminal wall" view for many running sessions. Each card can show the latest reconstructed terminal state or a compact text preview, enough to spot runs that are stuck, waiting for input, completed, or failed.

### View A Session Live

The developer can open a running session and watch the terminal update as events arrive.

The live view should support:

- Auto-follow output while the developer is watching live.
- Pause viewing without pausing the process.
- Return to live after pausing or jumping around.
- Stop or kill the process.
- Show the current scenario step beside the terminal.
- Show the active `waitForText`, `assertText`, or `assertRegion` beside the terminal.
- Show scripted user input and explicit markers on the timeline as they happen.

Live viewing and replay use the same event log. The live view is just a player attached to a run that is still recording.

### Inspect Failures First

When a run fails, the UI should open at the useful point by default.

For a failed assertion, show:

- The failed step.
- Expected text or region attributes.
- Actual visible text.
- Actual cell attributes for failed region checks.
- The terminal state at failure time.
- Nearby user input, markers, resize events, and PTY output events.

For a crashed or killed run, show:

- Final reconstructed terminal state.
- Exit code or signal.
- Last scenario step reached.
- Last PTY output time.
- Recent event list.

### Replay A Run

The developer can replay a finished or running run from the beginning.

The player should support:

- Play and pause.
- Speed control.
- Jump to a marker.
- Jump to a user input event.
- Jump to an assertion.
- Jump to process exit.
- Jump to start or end.
- Show raw event details around the current replay time.
- Search visible text and event metadata.

The first version does not need fast arbitrary seeking. If a user jumps to a late point in a long run, the player may replay events from the start to reconstruct that point.

### Rerun And Compare

The developer can rerun the same scenario with the same parameters.

The UI should support:

- Rerun.
- Clone run parameters and edit before launch.
- Group reruns together.
- Compare current status, duration, exit status, and assertion results across reruns.

### Handy Features

These are not required for the first usable slice, but the design should leave room for them:

- YAML scenario editor with validation before launch.
- Saved parameter presets for common commands, working directories, terminal sizes, and environment overrides.
- No-output warning when a run has produced no PTY output for a configurable time.
- Shareable local links to a run, marker, timestamp, or failed assertion.
- Run history filters by scenario, status, command, working directory, label, and time.

## Run Configuration

Each run is created from a YAML file. Multiple runs may be active at the same time, and each active run has its own run ID, PTY process, event log, validator state, and web replay state.

Example:

```yaml
name: review-current-branch

command: pnpm
args:
  - --filter
  - kimi-code
  - dev:cli-only

cwd: /Users/moonshot/Developer/kimi-code-worktrees/feat-code-review

cols: 120
rows: 36

env:
  KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_CODE_REVIEW: "1"

steps:
  - waitForText: "How can I help?"
    timeoutMs: 30000

  - mark: "start review"

  - send: "/review\n"

  - waitForText: "What to review"
    timeoutMs: 10000

  - key: "Enter"

  - waitForText: "Review intensity"
    timeoutMs: 10000

  - key: "Enter"

  - mark: "review running"

  - waitForText: "Review completed"
    timeoutMs: 1800000

  - assertText: "Review completed"

  - assertRegion:
      row: 1
      col: 1
      width: 80
      height: 1
      text: "Review completed"
      fg: ansi.green

  - mark: "done"
```

A scenario may also be launched as part of a suite. A suite is only a convenience wrapper for starting many runs; it does not impose scheduling or hidden environment policy.

```yaml
runs:
  - scenario: ./scenarios/review-current-branch.yaml
  - scenario: ./scenarios/review-working-tree.yaml
  - scenario: ./scenarios/review-single-commit.yaml
```

## YAML Step Types

The first version should support these declarative steps:

```yaml
- send: "literal text\n"
```

Sends literal bytes to the PTY.

```yaml
- key: "Enter"
```

Sends a named key sequence. The first version should support common keys such as `Enter`, `Escape`, `Tab`, `Backspace`, `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`, `Ctrl-C`, and `Ctrl-D`.

```yaml
- sleepMs: 1000
```

Waits for a fixed duration.

```yaml
- resize:
    cols: 140
    rows: 40
```

Resizes the PTY and records a resize event.

```yaml
- waitForText: "Review completed"
  timeoutMs: 1800000
```

Replays output into a terminal model until the visible screen contains the text, or fails on timeout.

```yaml
- assertText: "Review completed"
```

Checks that the current visible screen contains the text.

```yaml
- assertRegion:
    row: 1
    col: 1
    width: 80
    height: 1
    text: "Review completed"
    fg: ansi.green
    bg: default
    attrs:
      - bold
```

Checks a rectangular terminal region. Coordinates are 1-based terminal cell coordinates. The text match uses the visible characters in that rectangle. Attribute matches inspect terminal model cell attributes from the ANSI stream, not rendered pixels or a visible terminal theme.

Supported attribute values in the first version:

- Foreground/background: `default`, `ansi.black`, `ansi.red`, `ansi.green`, `ansi.yellow`, `ansi.blue`, `ansi.magenta`, `ansi.cyan`, `ansi.white`, bright ANSI variants, `index.N`, and `rgb.#rrggbb`.
- Text style attributes: `bold`, `dim`, `italic`, `underline`, `inverse`, and `strikethrough`.

```yaml
- mark: "review running"
```

Adds a marker to the event log. Markers appear on the replay progress bar.

## Event Log

Each run writes an append-only event log. Events are timestamped relative to process start.

Required event types:

- `process_start`
- `pty_output`
- `user_input`
- `resize`
- `marker`
- `assertion`
- `process_exit`

Example:

```json
{"t":0,"type":"process_start","command":"pnpm","args":["--filter","kimi-code","dev:cli-only"],"cwd":"/repo","cols":120,"rows":36}
{"t":812,"type":"pty_output","data":"base64-encoded-bytes"}
{"t":4520,"type":"user_input","label":"send","data":"base64-encoded-bytes"}
{"t":4521,"type":"marker","label":"start review"}
{"t":927000,"type":"assertion","label":"Review completed","status":"passed"}
{"t":928100,"type":"process_exit","exitCode":0,"signal":null}
```

PTY output and user input are stored as base64 so the log can preserve arbitrary bytes.

## Storage Layout

Runs are stored under a dedicated run directory.

```text
tty-runs/
  run-abc123/
    run.json
    events.jsonl
    events.jsonl.gz
    assertions.json
```

`run.json` stores run metadata:

- Run ID.
- Scenario name.
- Scenario file path.
- Command and arguments.
- Working directory.
- Environment overrides.
- Terminal size.
- Start time.
- End time.
- Exit code or signal.
- Final status: `running`, `passed`, `failed`, `killed`, or `crashed`.
- Parent suite ID, if the run was launched by a suite.

`events.jsonl` is written while the process is active. After the run ends, it may be compressed to `events.jsonl.gz` in the background. The uncompressed file can be removed after compression succeeds.

`assertions.json` stores assertion summaries for fast list views. The source of truth remains the event log.

## Live And Replay

The web player consumes events in timestamp order. For a running process, it follows new events as they are recorded. For a completed process, it replays the stored event log.

Player behavior:

- PTY output events are written into the browser terminal player.
- User input events are shown as progress-bar markers and optional inline annotations.
- Marker events are shown on the progress bar.
- Assertion events are shown on the progress bar with pass or fail status.
- Resize events resize the browser terminal model at the correct replay time.
- Process exit is shown as the terminal state.

Player controls:

- Play and pause.
- Auto-follow for live runs.
- Return to live for running sessions.
- Speed control.
- Jump to marker.
- Jump to user input.
- Jump to assertion.
- Jump to start or end.
- Show final screen.
- Show raw event details around the current replay time.

The first version does not need fast arbitrary seeking. If a user jumps to a late point in a long run, the player may replay events from the start to reconstruct that point.

## Validation

Validation uses the terminal model reconstructed from recorded events.

The validator should maintain a terminal model while the scenario runs. `waitForText` and `assertText` inspect the model's current visible text. `assertRegion` inspects visible text and ANSI cell attributes in a rectangular region.

Validation should not inspect raw output directly because raw PTY bytes include cursor movement, redraws, alternate screen control, and other ANSI sequences.

Validation output:

- Step index.
- Expected text.
- Expected region and attributes, if applicable.
- Pass or fail.
- Timestamp.
- Timeout, if applicable.
- Current visible screen text on failure.
- Current region cell attributes on failure, if applicable.

## Process Handling

The run manager starts each command under a PTY. Each process runs hidden in the background. Many runs may be active concurrently.

The runner uses the command, arguments, working directory, environment overrides, and terminal size specified by the scenario. It should not add hidden environment behavior beyond what is needed to start the process and record the run.

If the scenario completes and the process is still alive, the run may either leave it running or terminate it based on a scenario option:

```yaml
onScenarioComplete: terminate
```

Allowed values:

- `terminate`
- `leaveRunning`

If the process crashes or is killed:

- Record `process_exit`.
- Stop executing scenario steps.
- Mark the run failed, killed, or crashed.
- Preserve the event log.
- Show the final reconstructed terminal state in the web UI.

No repair or resume flow is included.

## Web App

Build a new web app for run inspection and live monitoring.

Views:

1. **Launcher**
   Starts one run from a scenario or starts a suite. Lets the developer override command, arguments, working directory, environment, terminal size, and labels before launch.

2. **Dashboard**
   Shows active and recent runs. Includes status, current step, active wait or assertion, elapsed time, last output time, command, working directory, terminal size, and assertion summary.

3. **Terminal Wall**
   Shows many running sessions in compact cards, with enough terminal preview to identify stuck, waiting, completed, failed, and crashed runs.

4. **Run Detail**
   Shows metadata, event counts, assertion results, current step, and the live/replay player.

5. **Live/Replay Player**
   Shows a terminal player with timeline markers for user input, explicit marks, assertions, resize events, and process exit. For running sessions it can follow live output. For completed sessions it replays the stored event log.

6. **Failure Inspector**
   Opens at the failed assertion or process exit. Shows expected values, actual terminal state, nearby events, and the final reconstructed screen.

7. **Suite Detail**
   Shows all runs launched together, their current status, assertion summaries, and quick links into each live view or replay.

8. **Run History**
   Searches and filters previous runs by scenario, status, command, working directory, label, and time.

## Server Support

The web app needs server support for these capabilities. The exact route shape is an implementation detail.

- Start one run from YAML.
- Start a suite that launches many runs together.
- List active, recent, and historical runs.
- Read run metadata and assertion summaries.
- Stream new events for live viewing.
- Read stored event logs for replay.
- Stop or kill a run.
- Rerun a prior run with the same parameters.
- Clone prior run parameters for editing before launch.
- Read raw event details around a timestamp, marker, assertion, or process exit.

## Implementation Phases

1. Add scenario schema and YAML parser.
2. Add run manager that can start, track, list, and stop many hidden PTY processes.
3. Add event recorder with `process_start`, `pty_output`, `user_input`, `resize`, `marker`, `assertion`, and `process_exit`.
4. Add YAML step executor for `send`, `key`, `sleepMs`, `resize`, `waitForText`, `assertText`, `assertRegion`, and `mark`.
5. Add validation against a terminal model, including visible text and ANSI cell attributes.
6. Add run storage and background gzip compression after completion.
7. Add live event streaming support for running sessions.
8. Add server support for launch, list, detail, stop, rerun, suites, stored replay, and raw event inspection.
9. Add new web app launcher, dashboard, terminal wall, run detail, live/replay player, failure inspector, suite detail, and run history.
10. Add one sample code-review scenario and one sample suite.
