# Headless Mode Implementation Tracker

## Current Milestone

Implement the headless command surface first.

This milestone shall cover:

- `kimi headless run` option parsing.
- `kimi headless --goal` shortcut parsing.
- `kimi headless status` parsing.
- `kimi headless goal pause|cancel|interrupt` parsing.
- main entry routing to the headless handler.
- prompt-mode regression coverage for `kimi -p`.

## Progress

- [x] Command parsing tests written.
- [x] Command parsing tests fail for the missing feature.
- [x] Command parsing and routing implemented.
- [x] Focused tests pass.
- [x] CLI help checked.
- [x] Self-contained commit created: `4d26627 feat: add headless command surface`.

## Current Milestone 2

Implement headless status, output-file, control, and approval helpers.

This milestone shall cover:

- Atomic status file writes and reads.
- Status file preflight.
- Metadata header formatting.
- Output directory resolution.
- Atomic response and goal-status file writes.
- Control request writes and reads.
- Non-fatal unused plan flag warnings.

Goal control semantics:

- `pause_goal` shall match TUI `/goal pause`: finish the current turn, then stop before the next goal turn.
- `cancel_goal` shall finish the current turn, then cancel the goal before the next goal turn.
- `interrupt` shall stop the active turn immediately and leave the goal paused when possible.

## Milestone 2 Progress

- [x] Helper tests written.
- [x] Helper tests fail for missing modules.
- [x] Helper modules implemented.
- [x] Focused tests pass.
- [x] Typecheck passes.
- [x] Self-contained commit created.

## Current Milestone 3

Add SDK session run locking.

This milestone shall cover:

- `packages/node-sdk/src/session-lock.ts`.
- `acquireSessionRunLock` exported from the SDK.
- `session.locked` public error code.
- Live lock rejection.
- Dead-pid stale lock replacement.
- Guarded release that does not remove another run's lock.

## Milestone 3 Progress

- [x] Lock tests written.
- [x] Lock tests fail for missing helper.
- [x] Lock helper implemented.
- [x] Focused tests pass.
- [x] Typecheck passes.
- [x] Build passes.
- [x] Self-contained commit created.
