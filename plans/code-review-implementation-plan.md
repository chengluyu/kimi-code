# Code Review Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` (recommended) or `superpowers:executing-plans` to implement this plan task by task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build a built-in `/review` command with Standard, Thorough, and Deep review intensities, read-only reviewer workers, audited coverage, provenance-preserving reconciliation, and `AgentSwarm`-backed Deep review.

**Architecture:** The TUI owns interaction and display, the SDK exposes typed review APIs, and `packages/agent-core` owns review state, git target resolution, review tools, reviewer orchestration, coverage auditing, and reconciliation. Start behind an experimental flag and ship the feature in slices: Standard first, then Thorough, then Deep.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Vitest, existing RPC layer, existing subagent host, existing profile system, existing permission policy system, existing TUI `ChoicePickerComponent`.

---

## Lifecycle Map

The review lifecycle crosses these project areas:

- `apps/kimi-code/src/tui/commands`: add `/review`, parse optional focus text, and launch the selector flow.
- `apps/kimi-code/src/tui/components/dialogs`: reuse `ChoicePickerComponent` for scope, base/commit selection, intensity, perspective confirmation, and stop-review confirmation.
- `apps/kimi-code/src/tui/controllers`: route review progress events and cancellation into the live UI.
- `packages/node-sdk/src`: expose typed review methods so the app never imports `@moonshot-ai/agent-core` directly.
- `packages/agent-core/src/rpc`: add review RPC payloads and methods.
- `packages/agent-core/src/review`: new review domain runtime: targets, assignments, comments, coverage, progress, orchestration, reconciliation.
- `packages/agent-core/src/tools/builtin/collaboration/agent-swarm.ts`: Deep reviewer execution must use the existing `AgentSwarm` tool contract, not a separate reviewer launcher.
- `packages/agent-core/src/session/subagent-batch.ts` and `packages/agent-core/src/agent/swarm`: Deep review must preserve the existing `AgentSwarm` child execution and `AgentSwarm` mode lifecycle.
- `packages/agent-core/src/tools/builtin/review`: new review-safe tools: `GetAssignment`, `GetChangedFiles`, `ReadPatch`, `ReadFileVersion`, `UpdateProgress`, `AddComment`, `GetComments`, `GetCommentEvidence`, `MergeComments`, `DismissComment`.
- `packages/agent-core/src/profile/default`: add `reviewer` and `reconciliator` profiles, then register them as subagent profiles for the main agent.
- `packages/agent-core/src/agent/permission/policies`: add a review-mode guard that blocks mutation and orchestration tools for review workers.
- `packages/agent-core/src/agent/injection`: inject review background and assignment context at reviewer turn start and after compaction.
- `apps/kimi-code/src/tui/controllers/subagent-event-handler.ts` and `apps/kimi-code/src/tui/components/messages/agent-swarm-progress.ts`: Deep reviewer progress should render through the existing `AgentSwarm` UI.

## Phase 0: Feature Flag and Shared Types

Purpose: create the compile-time and runtime surface without changing user behavior.

**Files:**

- Modify: `packages/agent-core/src/flags/registry.ts`
- Create: `packages/agent-core/src/review/types.ts`
- Create: `packages/agent-core/src/review/index.ts`
- Modify: `packages/agent-core/src/index.ts`
- Modify: `packages/node-sdk/src/types.ts`

**Tasks:**

- [x] Add experimental flag `code_review` in `packages/agent-core/src/flags/registry.ts` with env `KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_CODE_REVIEW`, default `false`, surface `both`.
- [x] Define review enums and data types in `packages/agent-core/src/review/types.ts`:
  - `ReviewScopeKind = 'working_tree' | 'current_branch' | 'single_commit'`
  - `ReviewIntensity = 'standard' | 'thorough' | 'deep'`
  - `ReviewFileStatus = 'added' | 'modified' | 'deleted' | 'renamed' | 'untracked'`
  - `ReviewProgressStatus = 'active' | 'complete' | 'blocked'`
  - `ReviewCommentSeverity = 'critical' | 'important' | 'minor'`
  - `ReviewTarget`, `ReviewFileChange`, `ReviewDiffStats`, `ReviewAssignment`, `ReviewComment`, `ReviewMergedComment`, `ReviewProgress`
- [x] Export review types from `packages/agent-core/src/review/index.ts` and `packages/agent-core/src/index.ts`.
- [x] Re-export public SDK-facing review types from `packages/node-sdk/src/types.ts`.
- [x] Add unit tests for type-facing validators when they are backed by Zod schemas. Prefer `packages/agent-core/test/review/types.test.ts` if no nearby review test exists yet. No validator tests were needed in Phase 0 because the slice adds type-only aliases and interfaces.

**Verification:**

- [x] Run `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/agent-core run typecheck`.
- [x] Run `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/kimi-code-sdk run typecheck`.

## Phase 1: Git Target Resolver and Diff Preview

Purpose: support scope selection and diff-stat preview before any model work starts.

**Files:**

- Create: `packages/agent-core/src/review/git-target.ts`
- Create: `packages/agent-core/src/review/git-target.test-support.ts`
- Create: `packages/agent-core/test/review/git-target.test.ts`
- Modify: `packages/agent-core/src/review/index.ts`

**Tasks:**

- [x] Implement `resolveReviewTarget(kaos, input)` for:
  - working tree changes
  - current `HEAD` against a selected branch, commit, or tag
  - one selected commit
- [x] Implement `listReviewBaseRefs(kaos)` returning local branches, tags, and recent commits for the TUI selector.
- [x] Implement `listReviewCommits(kaos)` for the single-commit selector.
- [x] Implement `previewReviewTarget(kaos, target)` returning:
  - file count
  - added lines
  - deleted lines
  - changed file manifest
- [x] Make untracked files part of working-tree review. For untracked text files, treat the whole file as an added patch.
- [x] Keep this layer model-free and side-effect-free. It may run read-only git commands through Kaos, but must not write to the repository.
- [x] Test renamed, deleted, untracked, and single-commit cases.

**Verification:**

- [x] Run `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/agent-core exec vitest run packages/agent-core/test/review/git-target.test.ts`. Executed as `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/agent-core exec vitest run test/review/git-target.test.ts` because Vitest runs from the package directory.

## Phase 2: Review Runtime Store, Coverage, and Comments

Purpose: create central session-owned review state that workers and reconciliators can update through tools.

- Modify: `packages/agent-core/src/agent/index.ts`

**Tasks:**

- [x] Add a `SessionReviewRuntime` that stores active review runs, assignments, progress, comments, merged comments, dismissed comments, and coverage.
- [x] Add a per-agent review facade, passed from `Session.instantiateAgent`, so an agent can call review tools without storing a session or agent id directly on `Agent`.
- [x] Preserve the existing rule that `Agent` remains usable standalone. If no review facade is supplied, review tools should not be active and review injections should no-op.
- [x] Implement coverage tracking for:
  - patch hunks read through `ReadPatch`
  - file line ranges read through `ReadFileVersion`
  - full-file coverage completion for multi-call large file reads
- [x] Implement comment state:
  - `AddComment` creates candidate comments and returns a comment id
  - `MergeComments` creates merged comments and stores source comment ids
  - `DismissComment` stores dismissal reason and optional merged comment id
- [x] Enforce invariants in runtime methods:
  - `AddComment` requires the cited path and line to be covered
  - `MergeComments` requires at least one source comment
  - `MergeComments` requires cited path and line support from source coverage
  - `UpdateProgress({ status: 'complete' })` fails while required coverage is missing
- [x] Add unit tests for coverage and comment invariants.

**Verification:**

- [x] Run `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/agent-core exec vitest run packages/agent-core/test/review/runtime.test.ts`. Executed as `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/agent-core exec vitest run test/review/runtime.test.ts` because Vitest runs from the package directory.

  - `GetCommentEvidence({ comment_id })`
  - `MergeComments({ source_comment_ids, severity, path, line, title, body, evidence?, suggested_fix? })`
  - `DismissComment({ comment_id, reason, summary, merged_comment_id? })`
- [x] Keep descriptions direct and imperative. Avoid names or prose that make tools sound like general editing tools.
- [x] Make all tools return structured JSON strings where the model needs machine-readable missing requirements.
- [x] Register review tools only when the agent has an active review facade. They should not appear in normal tool lists.
- [x] Test schemas, missing active assignment errors, coverage rejection, merge provenance, and dismissal reasons.

**Verification:**

- [x] Run `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/agent-core exec vitest run packages/agent-core/test/tools/review.test.ts`. Executed as `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/agent-core exec vitest run test/tools/review.test.ts` because Vitest runs from the package directory.

  - `ReadFileVersion`
- [x] Register both as subagent profiles in `agent.yaml`.
- [x] Add both YAML sources to `packages/agent-core/src/profile/default.ts`.
- [x] Add `ReviewModeGuardDenyPermissionPolicy` before auto/yolo approval policies. It should deny:
  - `Write`
  - `Edit`
  - `Bash`
  - `Agent`
  - `AgentSwarm`
  - `AskUserQuestion`
  - task and cron mutation tools
  - unknown non-review tools while a review assignment is active

- Create: `packages/agent-core/test/agent/injection/review.test.ts`
- Create: `packages/agent-core/test/review/worker-driver.test.ts`

**Tasks:**

- [x] Implement `ReviewInjector` that injects shared review background and the active assignment for reviewer and reconciliator workers.
- [x] Re-inject background after context clear and compaction.
- [x] Add a review-specific worker driver that:
  - starts a subagent with a review assignment
  - waits for a turn to complete
  - audits progress and coverage
  - continues the same subagent with missing requirements
  - stops when status is `complete` or `blocked`
  - fails after a bounded number of non-progress continuations
- [x] Keep the driver internal to review runtime for `Standard`, `Thorough`, and reconciliator runs. Do not route those through the generic model-facing `Agent` tool. `Deep` reviewer execution has a separate `AgentSwarm` requirement in Phase 11.

  - `listReviewBaseRefs()`
  - `listReviewCommits()`
  - `previewReviewTarget(input)`
  - `startReview(input)`
  - `cancelReview()`
- [x] Add RPC passthrough methods in `SDKRpcClientBase`.
- [x] Test that SDK methods call core RPC with `sessionId`.

**Verification:**

- [x] Run `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/kimi-code-sdk run typecheck`.
- [x] Run `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/kimi-code-sdk exec vitest run packages/node-sdk/test/session-review.test.ts`. Executed as `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/kimi-code-sdk exec vitest run test/session-review.test.ts` because Vitest runs from the package directory.

  - `Thorough   Multiple focused reviewers before opening a PR.`
  - `Deep       AgentSwarm-backed review for risky or large changes.`
- [x] For this phase, allow only `Standard` to start. Show “coming soon” notice for `Thorough` and `Deep` until later phases land.
- [x] Start review through `session.startReview()`.

## Phase 11: Deep Review with `AgentSwarm` and Grouped Reconciliators

Purpose: add `AgentSwarm`-backed reviewer execution with overlapping coverage and grouped reconciliation.

**Files:**

- Modify: `packages/agent-core/src/review/orchestrator.ts`
- Create: `packages/agent-core/src/review/coverage-matrix.ts`
- Modify: `packages/agent-core/src/tools/builtin/collaboration/agent-swarm.ts` if the tool needs review-assignment metadata, structured child status, or safer review display fields.
- Modify: `packages/agent-core/src/session/subagent-batch.ts` if review assignments need to be bound to `AgentSwarm` children at spawn time.
- Modify: `packages/agent-core/src/agent/swarm` only if review mode needs an explicit one-shot swarm lifecycle hook beyond the existing `tool` trigger.
- Create: `packages/agent-core/test/review/orchestrator-deep.test.ts`
- Create: `packages/agent-core/test/review/coverage-matrix.test.ts`
- Extend tests: existing `AgentSwarm` tool, subagent-batch, and TUI `AgentSwarmProgressComponent` tests as needed.
- Modify: `apps/kimi-code/src/tui/commands/review.ts`
- Modify: `apps/kimi-code/src/tui/controllers/subagent-event-handler.ts` only if Deep review does not already produce the normal `AgentSwarm` events.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Implement coverage matrix creation for changed files.
- [x] Partition work by file group and perspective.
- [x] Ensure every changed file is assigned to at least two workers.
- [ ] Replace direct Deep reviewer launching with an `AgentSwarm` reviewer phase.
- [ ] Convert each coverage-matrix review assignment into one `AgentSwarm` item.
- [ ] Call `AgentSwarm` with `subagent_type: 'reviewer'`, a review-assignment `prompt_template`, and one item per assignment.
- [ ] Ensure each `AgentSwarm` child receives the active review facade, review background injection, and its assignment before it can use review tools.
- [ ] Preserve the `AgentSwarm` parent tool call id so child progress renders in the existing `AgentSwarm` UI.
- [ ] Require Deep workers to read assigned changed files in full through `ReadFileVersion`.
- [ ] Audit `AgentSwarm` child outcomes after the reviewer phase. Failed, cancelled, or incomplete children should either be resumed through `AgentSwarm` or make the review fail clearly.
- [ ] Launch multiple reconciliators grouped by perspective or subsystem after the `AgentSwarm` reviewer phase completes.
- [ ] Perspective reconciliator rule: combine comments from all subagents with the same perspective across all assigned file groups.
- [ ] Subsystem reconciliator rule: combine comments from all subagents that reviewed that subsystem across all perspectives assigned to that subsystem.
- [ ] Coordinator emits final review from merged comments.
- [ ] Enable `Deep` in the intensity selector only after the reviewer phase uses the `AgentSwarm` path.

**Verification:**

- [x] Run `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/agent-core exec vitest run packages/agent-core/test/review/coverage-matrix.test.ts`. Executed with `test/review/coverage-matrix.test.ts test/review/orchestrator-deep.test.ts` because Vitest runs from the package directory.
- [ ] Add and run an orchestrator test proving Deep launches reviewers through `AgentSwarm`, not direct worker launching.
- [ ] Add and run a TUI/controller test proving Deep reviewer progress is handled as `AgentSwarm` progress.
- [ ] Run `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/agent-core exec vitest run test/review/orchestrator-deep.test.ts` after the `AgentSwarm` correction lands.

## Phase 12: Final Docs, Changeset, and Full Verification

Purpose: prepare the feature for review.

**Files:**

- Modify docs through `gen-docs` if the user-facing `/review` behavior is enabled in this branch.
- Add changeset under `.changeset/` through `gen-changesets`.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Run `gen-docs` skill if `/review` is user-visible. Updated bilingual slash-command and experimental-flag docs; `docs/scripts/sync-changelog.mjs` was not present, so changelog sync could not run.
- [x] Run `gen-changesets` skill. Use `minor` unless the final behavior is judged breaking and the user explicitly confirms a major bump.
- [x] Run package checks:
  - `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/agent-core run typecheck`
  - `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/kimi-code-sdk run typecheck`
  - `pnpm --filter @moonshot-ai/kimi-code run typecheck`
- [x] Run focused tests from all previous phases.
- [x] Run `pnpm test` if time allows.
- [x] Manually smoke test:
  - `/review` working tree with one small change
  - `/review focus on security` current branch against base
  - cancellation during active review
  - Thorough with duplicate comments
  - Deep with `AgentSwarm` progress and at least one file covered by multiple workers
  - Covered by focused command, event, and orchestrator smoke tests rather than a live model-backed TUI session.

## Rollout Strategy

- Keep `code_review` default off until Standard, TUI flow, cancellation, and docs are complete.
- Enable only `Standard` internally first.
- Enable `Thorough` only after reconciliator provenance is tested.
- Enable `Deep` only after the reviewer phase uses the `AgentSwarm` path, the TUI renders `AgentSwarm` progress, and coverage matrix plus grouped reconciliators are tested.
- Do not add auto-fix, GitHub PR comments, or separate `/security-review` in this implementation.

## Self-Review Checklist

- [x] `/review <focus>` maps to the user-facing flow in `plans/code-review-command-design.md`.
- [x] Review tool names match `plans/orchestration.md`: no `Review*` prefix in model-facing names.
- [x] The model never needs to pass `review_id` or `assignment_id`.
- [x] Reviewer workers cannot mutate files or launch more agents.
- [x] Background is injected at reviewer start and after compaction.
- [x] `Thorough` uses exactly one reconciliator.
- [ ] `Deep` reviewer execution uses the `AgentSwarm` tool/runtime/UI path.
- [x] `Deep` uses grouped reconciliators by perspective or subsystem.
- [x] Every final multi-agent comment has source comment provenance.
- [x] `apps/kimi-code` calls only the SDK, never `@moonshot-ai/agent-core` directly.
