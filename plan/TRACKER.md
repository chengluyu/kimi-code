## Detours / Notes

(None yet.)

## Log

- Phase 1a complete: `SessionGoalStore` (`session/goal.ts`) owns durable goal state in
  `metadata.custom.goal`; `Session`/`Agent` wired with the store; goal error codes added;
  `updateSessionMetadata` reserves `custom.goal`. 33 goal tests pass; typecheck clean; no
  agent-core imports in app src.

### Detour notes (Phase 1a)

- `createGoal` accepts an optional `actor` (default `'user'`) so both the user path and the
  Phase 3 model `CreateGoal` tool can set `startedBy`/`updatedBy`. Plan signature unchanged
  otherwise.
- `recordEvaluatorVerdict` is implemented in 1a (state side); the consecutive-failure increment
  path is deferred to Phase 4d (recordEvaluatorVerdict resets failures on a produced verdict).
- Audit records (`goal.*` wire entries) are intentionally NOT wired in 1a — that is Phase 1b.

### Phase 1b

- Added 7 `goal.*` wire record types; replay ignores them (state is from `state.json`).
- `SessionGoalStore` gained lazy `auditSink`, pending queue, `flushPendingRecords()`,
  `normalizeMetadata()`; every mutating method now appends its audit record.
- Session flushes pending goal records after the main agent exists (createMain + resume) and
  runs `normalizeMetadata()` after `readMetadata()` on resume (active → paused).
- `goal.account_usage` uses `usageKind: 'token' | 'wall_clock'`. 62 goal/records tests pass;
  full agent-core suite (2281) green; typecheck clean.
